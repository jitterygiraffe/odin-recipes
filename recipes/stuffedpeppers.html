        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>½ cup brown rice</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 yellow bell peppers</li>
            <li>2 red bell peppers</li>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) cans natural tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 pinches freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring water and brown rice to a boil 
                in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, 
                cover, and simmer until rice is tender 
                and liquid is absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, warm a large skillet over 
                medium heat. Add beef, onion, and garlic 
                to the hot skillet; cook and stir until 
                meat is evenly browned and onion is 
                softened, about 5 minutes. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove and discard tops, seeds, and 
                membranes of green, red, and yellow 
                bell peppers. Arrange peppers in a 
                baking dish with the hollowed sides 
                facing upward. Slice the bottoms off 
                peppers if necessary so that they stand upright.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix browned beef, cooked rice, 1 can 
                tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, salt, 
                and pepper in a bowl. Spoon mixture into each 
                hollowed pepper. Mix remaining tomato sauce 
                with Italian seasoning in a bowl; pour over peppers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven, basting with 
                sauce every 15 minutes, until peppers are 
                tender, about 1 hour. Sprinkle peppers with 
                grated Parmesan cheese; serve warm.
            </li>
