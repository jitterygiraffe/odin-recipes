        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>8 carrots, sliced into 1/2-inch rounds</li>
            <li>8 stalks celery, chopped</li>
            <li>8 green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>4 green bell peppers, sliced</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 pinches freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 
                degrees F (190 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>Arrange chicken breasts on a baking sheet; spread carrots, 
                celery, green onion, bell pepper, and parsley around chicken. 
                Drizzle olive oil over chicken and vegetables; season with 
                Italian seasoning, chili powder, lemon pepper, salt, 
                and black pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is 
                no longer pink in the center and juices run 
                clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read 
                thermometer inserted into the center should 
                read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            </li>
