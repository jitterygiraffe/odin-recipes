    <article>
        <p>This hearty beef stew is the ultimate comfort food, p
            erfect for warming up on a chilly day. Rich, 
            tender chunks of beef are slow-cooked to perfection, 
            absorbing the deep flavors of a savory broth made with 
            aromatic herbs, garlic, onions, and tomatoes. The stew 
            is packed with wholesome vegetables like carrots, potatoes, 
            and celery, which simmer alongside the beef, soaking up the flavorful 
            juices and adding texture to the dish.</p>

        <p>As the stew simmers slowly, the beef becomes 
            melt-in-your-mouth tender, while the broth 
            thickens into a rich, flavorful sauce. This dish 
            is all about rustic, comforting flavors that make 
            you feel right at home with each spoonful. 
            The combination of herbs like thyme, bay leaves, 
            and a dash of red wine or Worcestershire sauce 
            adds layers of complexity, elevating the stew 
            to a satisfying and deeply nourishing meal.</p>

        <p>Perfect for family dinners, cold nights, 
            or whenever you need a little extra comfort, 
            this beef stew is best served with a side of 
            crusty bread to soak up the delicious broth. 
            It is a timeless classic that will leave 
            everyone feeling warm, cozy, and fully satisfied.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>8 carrots, sliced into 1/2-inch rounds</li>
            <li>8 stalks celery, chopped</li>
            <li>8 green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>4 green bell peppers, sliced</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 pinches freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 
                degrees F (190 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>Arrange chicken breasts on a baking sheet; spread carrots, 
                celery, green onion, bell pepper, and parsley around chicken. 
                Drizzle olive oil over chicken and vegetables; season with 
                Italian seasoning, chili powder, lemon pepper, salt, 
                and black pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is 
                no longer pink in the center and juices run 
                clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read 
                thermometer inserted into the center should 
                read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            </li>
